Deforestation

Deforestation is the clearing of forests, primarily to make way for agriculture, logging, and development. This practice has severe consequences for the environment, including climate change, loss of biodiversity, and soil erosion. When forests are cleared, the carbon stored in their trees is released into the atmosphere, contributing to greenhouse gas emissions. Additionally, deforestation destroys habitats for countless plant and animal species, leading to a decline in biodiversity.

Pollution

Pollution is the introduction of harmful substances into the environment. It can take many forms, including air pollution, water pollution, and land pollution. Air pollution is caused by the release of pollutants into the atmosphere, such as from vehicle exhaust, industrial emissions, and burning fossil fuels. Water pollution occurs when harmful substances contaminate water sources, such as rivers, lakes, and oceans. Land pollution results from the disposal of waste materials on the land, including litter, chemicals, and hazardous materials. Pollution has a detrimental impact on human health, ecosystems, and the overall quality of life.
